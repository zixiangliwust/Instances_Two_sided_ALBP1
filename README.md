# Instances_Two_sided_ALBP1
Instances for two-sided assembly line balancing problem to minimize the number of mated-station and (or) the number of stations  
This project contains the utilized instances in [1] (in folder of Instances) which contain most of the instances in published papers. To gain a more in-depth and thorough understanding of this problem, interested authors are encouraged to refer to our relevant papers[1-7].  

Instances for cost-oriented two-sided assembly line balancing problem with given cycle time to minimize the cost  
This project contains the instances utilized in [8] (in folder of Instances_Cost_TALBP1). The operation times and precedence relations are taken from the instances in. To gain a more in-depth and thorough understanding of this problem, interested authors are encouraged to refer to our relevant papers[8].
